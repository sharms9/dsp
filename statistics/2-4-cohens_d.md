>>The Cohen's d for total weight (comparison of first and subsequent births) is -0.0889 and for pregnancy lengths (for first and >>subsequent births) is 0.0289.  Mean weight for subsequent births is greater than for first borns. However, mean pregnancy length for >>the first born is greater than for subsequent births.  Essentially, first borns typically weigh less and the mother has a longer >>pregnancy.  Other children born typically weigh more and the mother has a shorter pregnancy.
