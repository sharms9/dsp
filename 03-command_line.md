# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

###Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

1. mv = This command is used to move files or renames them.
2. cp = This command is used to copy files. This command not only allows one to copy files directly but also to a file in another directory.
3. touch = This command creates an empty file.
4. cd = This command is used to change directories.  Allows one to move up and down.
5. pwd = This command outputs the present directory.
6. ls = This command lists the contents of the directory.
7. man = This command is used to look up details on a specific command.
8. grep = This command allows one to search files containing specific words or phrases.
9. * = This command matches anything in a wildcard.
10. rm = This command removes a file.
11. rmdir = This command removes an (empty) directory.
12. mkdir = This command creates a directory.
13. cat = This command outputs a whole file to the screen without page separation.
14. less = This command displays the file one page at a time.  Use "q" to exit.

###Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh`  
`ls -lah`  
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

ls = This command lists the complete contents of a directory.

ls -a = This command lists content with names that begin with a dot.

ls -l = This command lists the contents in long format, and provides full detail on access, size and when it was last updated.

ls -lh = This command lists the contents in long format.  However, unit suffixes are used for size of the file/directory to reduce the number of digits displayed.

ls -lah = This command lists the contents in long format of files that begin with a dot.  Again, unit suffixes are used to condense the digit size.

ls -t = This command lists content names from most recently modified and then alphabetically.

ls -Glp = This command lists in long format with the directory names in color and followed by a forward slash (/).

ls -g = This command lists the content in long format, but omits the owner name.
ls -m = This command lists the contents continuously and separated by a comma.
